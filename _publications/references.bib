abstract = {Cloud computing enables on-demand provisioning of computing resources to IT solutions, following a utility-based approach. Technology and standardization developments in traditional public utilities enable customers to seamlessly migrate across utility providers without being required to make changes to their home appliances. Dubbed as the fifth utility, cloud computing customers should have user-friendly tools and mechanisms at their disposal, which preserve application deployments across different resource providers. Here, the authors present current efforts to develop an open source Cloud Application Management Framework (CAMF) based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. This framework facilitates cloud application lifecycle management in a vendor-neutral approach. {\textcopyright} 1997-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper we show how Cloud application developers can utilize CAMF in order to have portable applications that can be deployed on different IaaS with minimal effort. Towards this goal, we introduce the Cloud Application Requirement Language (CARL). CARL can be used for defining the application software and hardware requirements, information that is then included into the TOSCA description of the Cloud application, alongside the application blueprint. CAMF's Information Service utilizes both these artifacts to provide IaaS specific configurations that fulfill the user's requirements. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

In this work we evaluate the benefits of caching vehicular information obtained from such VIS through VITP, a location-aware, application-layer communication protocol that we extend to support caching. We present an evaluation study of our approach conducting extensive simulation on large scale vehicular networks under different realistic urban traffic conditions Our results identify the critical parameters that affect information quality in VANETs as well as demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the cache-enabled VITP.},

abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks have emerged recently as a platform to support intelligent inter-vehicle communication and improve traffic safety and performance. The road-constrained and high mobility of the vehicles, their unbounded power source, and the emergence of roadside wireless infrastructures make VANETs a challenging research topic. A key to the development of protocols for intervehicle communication and services lies in the knowledge of the topological characteristics of the VANET communication graph. This article provides answers to the general question: how does a VANET communication graph look like over time and space? This study is the first one that examines a very large-scale VANET graph and conducts a thorough investigation of its topological characteristics using several metrics, not examined in previous studies. Our work characterizes a VANET graph at the connectivity (link) level, quantifies the notion of ¿qualitative¿ nodes as required by routing and dissemination protocols, and examines the existence and evolution of communities (dense clusters of vehicles) in the VANET. Several latent facts about the VANET graph are revealed and incentives for their exploitation in protocol design are examined.},
