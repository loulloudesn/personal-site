## Summary:
I am excited to announce that the [Cyprus Promotion Foundation](http://www.research.org.cy) has accepted my
research proposal on an innovative vehicle-based sensor network infrastructure.

VSense (Vehicular Sensor Network Infrastructure) is a two year research project
that aims to improve the performance of Vehicular Sensor Networks (VSN).
In a nutshell, the project will
  1. Study the dynamics and topology of large-scale VSNs from the viewpoint of complex networks,
  2. Design and propose a distributed middleware architecture that will support the establishment of VSNs,
  3. Investigate robust location-aware services that will improve the coordination of sensing tasks, large-scale sensor data aggregation and dissemination, query resolution and interconnection with the Internet.

VSense is backed by a strong collaboration network from partnerns such as
  - [University of Cyprus](http://www.ucy.ac.cy),
  - [University of Nicosia Research Foundation](https://www.unic.ac.cy/research/unrf),
  - [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/),
  - [University of Thessaly](http://www.uth.gr/en/),

who bring world-class expertise in research areas related to VSNs
